// This folder is for styles unique to specific pages. These might involve Compositional overrides for a particular layout on that page, or Exceptions that are only relevant in that page's context and don't warrant a generic component or utility.

// Example: _homepage.scss, _product-detail.scss. These files should ideally be small and primarily compose existing Blocks and Layouts, or apply minor, page-specific adjustments.
