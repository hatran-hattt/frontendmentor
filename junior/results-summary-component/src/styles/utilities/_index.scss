// *** CUBE Integration: 
// While some might put utilities in abstracts,
// creating a dedicated utilities/ folder (or at least a _utilities.scss file in abstracts) is ideal for CUBE Utilities (.u-utility-name).
// Note: Sass mixins and functions are incredibly useful and frequently used to define and generate utilities in CUBE CSS, especially for creating systematic and scalable utility classes.

// Example: _spacing.scss (e.g., .u-mt-s, .u-p-lg), _text.scss (e.g., .u-text-center, .u-text-bold), _visibility.scss (e.g., .u-hidden-mobile). These classes should be highly specific and often use !important to ensure they override other styles.

@use "../abstracts" as *;

@forward "exception";
@forward "layout";
@forward "text";
@forward "visibility";
