## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid, Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (CSS extension language)

### What I learned

#### 1. Alignment along the "justify" (inline) axis

> `justify-items`, `justify-content`, `justify-self`

- `justify-content`

  - Applies to: Flex Containers and Grid Containers.

  - Purpose: Aligns items (or tracks) as a group (or distributes space between/around them) along the main axis (in Flexbox) or the inline axis (in Grid, specifically if the grid tracks don't take up all available space). It deals with distributing extra space within the container.

- `justify-items`

  - Applies to: Grid Containers (implicitly applies to all direct grid items).

  - Purpose: Aligns the content inside each individual grid item along the inline axis (horizontal for writing-mode: horizontal-tb).

- `justify-self`

  - Applies to: Individual Grid Items.

  - Purpose: Aligns the content inside a single grid item along the inline axis. It overrides the justify-items property set on the container for that specific item.

#### 2. Background image with color layer

```
.cta .content {
  background-image:
    linear-gradient(to right, rgba(var(--color-bg-footer) ,0.75), rgba(#4D96A9,0.75)), /* Top layer: semi-transparent gradient */
    url('../assets/mobile/image-footer.jpg'); /* Bottom layer: actual image */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover; // Scales the image as large as possible without stretching it (clipped)
}
```

- CSS Gradients are a powerful feature that allows you to create smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. What's cool about them is that they are not actual image files (like .jpg or .png); instead, they are generated by the browser using CSS code. This means they are resolution-independent and extremely lightweight.

- They are technically considered an image data type in CSS and are typically used as a value for properties like background-image.

- There are two primary types of CSS gradients:

  - Linear Gradients (linear-gradient())

  - Radial Gradients (radial-gradient())

#### 3. Container-type interacting with the element's sizing.

```
**Problem sumary**

Grid template:
  Cell1 Cell2
  Cell3 Cell4 --> .content

CSS .content {
    container-type: inline-size;
    justify-self: center;
}

Problem: content shrink instead of take full width
Solution: explicitly set 'width: 100%' for content
```

While container-type is meant to define a query context, it can subtly affect the box model and sizing of the element itself.

When container-type: inline-size; is present without an explicit width: 100%; (or another width-defining property), the element might be defaulting to a "shrink-to-fit" width or a more content-based width rather than the full width of its grid area. This is a less common behavior for a standard block-level element but can happen when a special CSS context (like a container query context) is introduced.

#### 4. CSS tips

- Center item: `margin: auto;`
