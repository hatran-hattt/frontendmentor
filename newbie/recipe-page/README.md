## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

#### 1. Using semantic html5 element

- `<section>` is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. (Ex: Chapters, Introduction, Contact information)
- `<article>` element specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site. (Ex: Blog posts, User comments, Product cards, ...)

  > Note: So, you will find HTML pages with `<section>` elements containing `<article>` elements, and `<article>` elements containing `<section>`elements.

- `<header>` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

  > Note: You can have several `<header>` elements in one HTML document. However, `<header>` cannot be placed within a `<footer>`, `<address>`or another `<header>` element.

- `<ul>`, `<ol>`: "Preparation time" and "Ingredients" are unordered lists, while "Instructions" is an ordered list, reflecting the sequential nature of steps.

- `<strong>`: Used for the bolded keywords within the list items (Total, Beat the eggs, etc.) to semantically emphasize them.

- `<table>`'s `<caption>`, `<thead>`, `<th>` elements define the column headers for accessibility.
  > Use css class sr-only (screen-reader-only class) to visually hide content on web page, while still keeping it accessible to screen readers and other assistive technologies.
  >
  > - Simple definition: `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`
  > - Standard and widely accepted sr-only class definition:
  >
  > ```
  > .sr-only {
  >   /* Visually hidden but accessible to screen readers */
  >   position: absolute;
  >   width: 1px;
  >   height: 1px;
  >   padding: 0;
  >   margin: -1px;
  >   overflow: hidden;
  >   clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  >   white-space: nowrap;
  >   border: 0;
  > }
  > ```

#### 2. Custom style for list (marker)

- Apply css properties on list element

  - list-style-position allows you to move your bullet point to either inside or outside the list-item's contents. (default: outside)
  - list-style-image allows you to replace your list's bullet points with images.
  - list-style-type which changes the bullet points to known style keywords, custom strings, emoji and more.

- Use pseudo class `li::marker` - adds the ability to change the color, size, and spacing of markers.

  > Note: `::marker` gives you far more control over marker styles than list-style-type, but it doesn't work with every CSS property. The following properties are allowed:
  >
  > `animation-\_
  > transition-\_
  > color
  > direction
  > font-\*
  > content
  > unicode-bidi
  > white-space

- For full control, use a custom marker with `li::before` (remember to reset defaul list style `ul/ol:list-style: none;`)

  - Example: unorder list

    > ```
    > .recipe-section__list > li::before {
    >        content: "â€¢";
    >        display: inline-block;
    >        color: ...
    >        width: ... /* Controls space */
    >        }
    > ```

  - Example: order list (use custom-counter for numbering)
    > ```
    > .recipe-instructions\_\_list {
    > counter-reset: custom-counter;
    > }
    > .recipe-instructions**list > li {
    > counter-increment: custom-counter;
    > }
    > .recipe-instructions**list > li::before {
    > content: counter(custom-counter) ".";
    > }
    > ```

#### 3. Style for table

> Reference: https://estelle.github.io/CSS/tables/#slide1

- Setting gap between cells: table's border-collapse (collapse, ...)
- Setting border: td's border

#### 4. Give inline element more space

> display: inline-block; // ex: give space arround span

#### 5. Controlling the alignment of text in a list item when it wraps to a new line (`hanging indent`) TODO

- Using Flexbox (Most Recommended for Modern Layouts) for `<li>`
  > use when item contains only marker & 1 content
- Using text-indent (Traditional, Less Flexible)
  > This method involves a negative text-indent on the `<li>` and a positive padding-left to push the first line over.
